## Python Flask Application Design: 
### Flutter App Google Doc to Markdown Conversion
---
### HTML Files
1. **index.html**: This is the main landing page of the application. It should contain a simple form that allows users to upload a Google Doc file. The user interface should be intuitive, and the form should include necessary fields, such as a file input field for selecting the Google Doc file and a submit button to initiate the conversion process.

2. **conversion_result.html**: This HTML file is responsible for displaying the markdown result after the conversion process is complete. It should have a container or section to display the converted markdown content. Additionally, it may include a button that allows users to download the markdown file for further use or reference.

### Routes
1. **Conversion Route**: This route is triggered when the user submits the Google Doc file for conversion. It should accept a POST request with the file uploaded by the user. The route should interact with the appropriate logic to handle the conversion process. This may involve parsing the Google Doc file, extracting the content, and converting it to markdown format. Once the conversion is complete, it should redirect the user to the `conversion_result.html` page to display the markdown output.

2. **Download Route**: This route is responsible for providing the download functionality for the converted markdown file. It should accept a GET request and respond with the markdown file as a response. The filename and appropriate headers should be set to ensure the file is downloaded with a relevant name and mime type.

### Advantages of this Design

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed to be user-friendly with a simple and intuitive form for uploading Google Doc files, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: The HTML files and routes are separated, allowing for a clean and maintainable codebase. The HTML files focus on presenting the user interface and displaying the results, while the routes handle the conversion process and file management.

3. **Efficient File Handling**: The design includes a dedicated download route, ensuring efficient delivery of the converted markdown file to the user. It provides a straightforward way to download the result without the need for additional user input or complex processes.

4. **Scalability and Extensibility**: This basic design can serve as a starting point for future enhancements and feature additions. As the application grows and new requirements arise, additional routes and HTML pages can be added to accommodate new functionalities.
